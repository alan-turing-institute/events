Professor Ronan Lyons (SAIL), Lynsey Cross (HDR-UK), and Meag Doherty (NIH-AoU) discuss PPIE best practices, and provide insight from their experiences leading PPIE efforts at a National level.

**Friday 16th September, 10:00 - 11:00**

## Public Involvement for Better Research

The genuine inclusion of individuals from diverse backgrounds is both an ethical imperative and vital for scientific validity. Failing to reach and involve affected people, or distorting or diminishing their input, makes research less comprehensive and nuanced while representative research, incorporating a rich range of perspectives, improves scientific validity, and delivers broader and more equitable impact.

This Discussion Panel will draw on the expertise of PPIE leaders to provide insights, best practices, and lessons learned for how projects can involve patients and members of the public in a research project in a way that supports public engagement and improves research output.

The session will be hosted on Zoom, please contact the AIM RSF Community Manager at sbatchelor@turing.ac.uk for joining details.
