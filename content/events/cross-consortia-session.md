The session will be hosted on Zoom, please contact the AIM RSF Community Manager at sbatchelor@turing.ac.uk for joining details.

## Citizen Science and Co-creation



## About AutSPACEs

AutSPACEs is a community-led citizen science project seeking to make environments more accessible for autistic people.

Around 90% of autistic people process sensory information differently to non-autistic people. As a result, many public spaces are not well designed for autistic people. They may be too bright, busy or loud.

The Alan Turing Institute is working with Autistica and Open Humans to use citizen science to understand what autistic people would like to change about these public spaces. We are building an online platform openly on GitHub, and make the code, process documentation, and focus group design data publicly available.

Autistic people have been involved throughout the research cycle, including setting priorities, making research design decisions, interpreting data, and co-authoring and co-presenting work. We run Collaboration Sessions twice per month to welcome new members and provide support for ongoing initiatives including online moderation and platform infrastructure.
