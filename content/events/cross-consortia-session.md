Cross-Consortia Sessions are open to all members of the AIM Consortia and RSF affiliates. In this session, AutSPACEs research team will present on the methods of public engagement, co-design, and inclusive research that have led to the success of an entirely co-created research project.

**Friday 16th September, 10:00 - 11:00**

## Citizen Science and Co-creation



## About AutSPACEs

AutSPACEs is a community-led citizen science project seeking to make environments more accessible for autistic people.

Around 90% of autistic people process sensory information differently to non-autistic people. As a result, many public spaces are not well designed for autistic people. They may be too bright, busy or loud.

The Alan Turing Institute is working with Autistica and Open Humans to use citizen science to understand what autistic people would like to change about these public spaces. We are building an online platform openly on GitHub, and make the code, process documentation, and focus group design data publicly available.

Autistic people have been involved throughout the research cycle, including setting priorities, making research design decisions, interpreting data, and co-authoring and co-presenting work. We run Collaboration Sessions twice per month to welcome new members and provide support for ongoing initiatives including online moderation and platform infrastructure.
