## What are Collaboration Cafes.

AIM RSF Collaboration Cafes are drop in co-working sessions focused on collaboration and community building.
Sessions are open to anyone working on AIM projects and occur on the third Thursday of every month.

Sessions are hosted on Zoom; If you don't already have a calendar invite and would like to attend, please contact the Community Manager for Open Collaboration, Eirini Zormpa at ezormpa@turing.ac.uk

## How the AIM RSF runs Collaboration Cafes.

During Collaboration Cafes, attendees go into breakout rooms and either work with others to solve a common problem or focus on quiet working (e.g. writing).

In terms of **collaboration**, these sessions give attendees a chance to learn what other members of the AIM consortia have been working on and identify areas of common interest.
They are also a great place to meet people that have expertise in relevant methodologies or programming languages.

Collaboration Cafes can also be great for **quiet work** as they provide social motivation and support; for example, in a break-out room where everyone is working writing their own papers, it can be helpful to your motivation that everyone else in the room is struggling with the same task.

## About the event

We will spend some time getting to know each other and the problems we are facing.
You will be able to ask fellow members of the AIM RSF for their support, ideas, examples of data management, training, and PPIE.
For example, Eirini Zormpa (Community Manager for Open Collaboration) would love to work on some shared documentation about AIM projects and methods and Sophia Batchelor will lead a session on co-developing a glossary of terms used across the AIM Consortia.
