# AIM RSF Events

Each month, the AIM Research Support Facility hosts a range of events open to
the AIM Consortia and Research Partners. Many of the sessions (such as the Open Talks Seminar Series) have an open invitation and welcome any researchers or members of the public interested in the topic to attend. Other sessions have been designed to support knowledge sharing across our community and are for internal AIM consortia only. Our events have been developed to foster collaboration and support the goals of each AIM consortium. Please contact us at aimrsf@turing.ac.uk if you would like to attend one of our events.
