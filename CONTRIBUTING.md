# Contributing to this Repository

üéâ First off, thank you for taking the time to contribute! üéâ

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to alan-turing-institute.github.io/events/ on GitHub. As this is an ongoing project, when contributing please use your best judgement as to how your contribution can help the project and feel free to propose changes to this document in a Pull Request.
You can suggest topics to include in this repository, report mistakes/bugs, create Pull Requests to fix an error, offer resources or help develop or review the training materials.

## ü§î What should I know before I contribute? 

The AIM RSF hosts a mix of internal (AIM members and affiliate researchers only) and external (open to everyone) events. As part of this, we are trialling ways to make our events schedule avaliable to those who want to get involved in AIM projects. alan-turing-institute.github.io/events/ is the informal GitHub pages site that we're currently testing out to inform researchers and members of the public about our events. 
As a result, the AIM RSF management team reserves the right to have final say on any content that will be added to this repo in order to make sure that it aligns with the goals of the programme, and the communications we have about our events.
This repository uses GitHub Pages built with Hugo (with the Hugo Serif theme for styling).

## Style Guides :art:

### Markdown style guide :pencil2:

The webpages are written in Markdown syntax and are automatically transformed into HTML by Hugo.

When writing content in Markdown, it is recommended to begin each new sentence on a new line.
(Check out the raw version of this file to see an example!)
Each sentence will be rendered as a single paragraph until a blank line is found, this will create a new paragraph.
This is the recommended way to write since, if/when changes are suggested during the review process, the GitHub User Interface will only highlight the sentence the changes have been requested for - not the whole paragraph.
This makes reviews much easier to read!

If you are not familiar with Markdown, checkout [GitHub's Guide to Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

- :fire: for removing files
