Public Involvement for Better Research The genuine inclusion of individuals from diverse backgrounds is both an ethical imperative and vital for scientific validity. Failing to reach and involve affected people, or distorting or diminishing their input, makes research less comprehensive and nuanced while representative research, incorporating a rich range of perspectives, improves scientific validity, and delivers broader and more equitable impact.</description></item><item><title>Cross-Consortia Session</title><link>https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/events/events/cross-consortia-session/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Nov 2018 15:14:54 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/events/events/cross-consortia-session/</guid><description>Cross-Consortia Sessions are open to all members of the AIM Consortia and RSF affiliates.
